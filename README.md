Sensitive Data Encryption and Hidden File Storage
This project demonstrates a secure method for handling sensitive data. It includes two key components: data encryption with hidden file storage and a local website for text encryption and decryption.

Features
Sensitive Data Encryption:

The system identifies sensitive data and encrypts it using secure algorithms.
The encrypted data is stored in a hidden file, ensuring enhanced security and preventing unauthorized access.
Web Interface:

A user-friendly local website (hosted on localhost) allows users to encrypt and decrypt text manually.
Users can enter text, encrypt it, and store the output securely or decrypt previously encrypted text using the interface.
How It Works
Data Processing:
Sensitive data is processed, encrypted, and stored automatically in a hidden file for additional security.

Local Website:
The web application provides an intuitive interface where users can:

Input sensitive data for encryption.
Retrieve and decrypt the data using the appropriate key.
This project combines machine learning to classify data as sensitive or non-sensitive and encryption techniques to secure it. It serves as a practical demonstration of securing data for personal or professional use.
